# Carousel and Visual Updates Summary

## Date: Latest Development Session

### Overview
This document summarizes the major UI improvements implemented to fix the carousel functionality and enhance the visual design of the Glow FM website.

---

## 1. Show Listings Carousel Implementation

### Problem
- All 9 shows were displaying in a static 3x3 grid
- No sliding carousel functionality
- Arrow buttons were non-functional

### Solution
Created a dedicated `ShowCarousel.tsx` component with:

**File**: `apps/web/components/ShowCarousel.tsx`

**Features**:
- **State Management**: Uses `useState` to track current index position
- **Navigation Logic**:
  - `nextSlide()`: Advances by 3 shows, wraps to beginning
  - `prevSlide()`: Goes back by 3 shows, wraps to end
- **Display**: Shows 3 programs at a time using `slice(currentIndex, currentIndex + 3)`
- **Pagination Dots**: Visual indicators showing current slide position (3 dots total)
- **Responsive Layout**: 3-column grid on desktop, single column on mobile
- **Hover Effects**: Shadow and translation effects for interactivity

**Show Data**:
All 9 shows included with proper metadata:
1. IJI AYO - Cultural & Entertainment (8:00am)
2. Millionaires Mindset - Business & Finance (10:00am)
3. Glow Kiddies - Children & Family (2:00pm)
4. LET's TALK - Discussion & Talk (4:00pm)
5. YOU AND THE LAW - Legal & Advice (6:00pm)
6. Love Saturday - Music & Romance (12:00pm)
7. Kayefi Nla - Culture & Society (7:00pm)
8. Women's World - Women & Lifestyle (3:00pm)
9. The News - News & Current Affairs (1:00pm)

**Integration**: Replaced entire static grid section in `page.tsx` with `<ShowCarousel />` component

---

## 2. Hero Section Grid Opacity Enhancement

### Problem
- Animated grid background was barely visible (10% opacity)
- Didn't match UI reference design

### Solution
**File**: `apps/web/app/page.tsx` (Line ~16)

**Change**: Increased opacity from `opacity-10` to `opacity-70`

**Result**: Grid background is now clearly visible while maintaining the parallax animation effect

---

## 3. Animated Gradient Background

### Problem
- Plain white background lacking visual interest
- No gradient effects as specified in design requirements

### Solution
**File**: `apps/web/app/globals.css`

**Implementation**:

```css
/* Animated Gradient Background with Purple, Orange, Navy Blue Ovals */
body::before {
  content: "";
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0;
  z-index: -1;
  background:
    radial-gradient(ellipse 800px 600px at 15% 25%, rgba(138, 43, 226, 0.20) 0%, transparent 50%),
    radial-gradient(ellipse 700px 700px at 85% 75%, rgba(255, 140, 0, 0.20) 0%, transparent 50%),
    radial-gradient(ellipse 600px 800px at 50% 50%, rgba(0, 0, 128, 0.20) 0%, transparent 50%);
  opacity: 1;
  pointer-events: none;
  backdrop-filter: blur(80px);
  animation: gradient-float 25s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
}

/* Glassy Translucent Layer */
body::after {
  content: "";
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0;
  z-index: -1;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.20);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

**Animation**:
```css
@keyframes gradient-float {
  0% { transform: translate3d(-2%, -2%, 0) scale(1); }
  33% { transform: translate3d(3%, 1%, 0) scale(1.05); }
  66% { transform: translate3d(-1%, 3%, 0) scale(1.03); }
  100% { transform: translate3d(2%, -1%, 0) scale(1); }
}
```

**Colors Used**:
- **Purple**: `rgba(138, 43, 226, 0.20)` - BlueViolet at 20% opacity
- **Orange**: `rgba(255, 140, 0, 0.20)` - DarkOrange at 20% opacity
- **Navy Blue**: `rgba(0, 0, 128, 0.20)` - Navy at 20% opacity

**Effects**:
- Glassy/translucent appearance with backdrop blur
- Smooth floating animation over 25 seconds
- Oval-shaped gradients positioned at different areas
- 20% transparency as specified

## 4. Files Modified

### New Files Created:
1. **`apps/web/components/ShowCarousel.tsx`** (164 lines)
   - Complete carousel implementation with navigation

### Files Updated:
1. **`apps/web/app/page.tsx`**
   - Added ShowCarousel import
   - Replaced static grid with carousel component
   - Increased hero grid opacity from 10% to 70%
   - Reduced from ~763 lines to ~437 lines (removed duplicate show listings)

2. **`apps/web/app/globals.css`**
   - Added animated gradient background with oval shapes
   - Added glassy translucent layer
   - Added gradient-float animation keyframes
   - Updated body pseudo-elements for new visual effects

---

## 5. Technical Details

### State Management
```tsx
const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);
const totalSlides = Math.ceil(shows.length / 3); // 3 slides total
```

### Navigation Functions
```tsx
const nextSlide = () => {
  setCurrentIndex((prev) => (prev + 3 >= shows.length ? 0 : prev + 3));
};

const prevSlide = () => {
  setCurrentIndex((prev) => (prev - 3 < 0 ? shows.length - 3 : prev - 3));
};
```

### Display Logic
```tsx
const visibleShows = shows.slice(currentIndex, currentIndex + 3);
```

## 6. Testing Status

### Local Development
✅ Development server running on `http://localhost:3000`

   - Check gradient background animation smoothness
   - Verify 20% transparency and oval shapes
   - Test on different screen sizes

3. **Add Ember Challenge Instructions**
   - Upload image to Google Drive
   - Add to drive-assets.ts
   - Create new section in page.tsx

4. **Update Countdown Styling**
   - Match font and style from UI reference
   - Ensure consistency with overall design

5. **Deploy to VPS**
   - Push changes to GitHub
   - SSH to VPS and pull latest code
   - Run build and restart PM2 process
   - Verify on glowfmradio.com
